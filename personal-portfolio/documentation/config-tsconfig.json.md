# TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)

**Purpose:** This file configures the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) for the Astro project. It specifies which files to include/exclude, sets compiler options, and often extends base configurations provided by Astro.

**Reference:** [TypeScript `tsconfig.json` Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)

## Current Configuration

```json
{
  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/strict",
  "include": [".astro/types.d.ts", "**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist"]
}
```

## Key Settings Explained

*   **`extends": "astro/tsconfigs/strict"`**: This line inherits compiler options from a base configuration file provided by Astro. The `strict` configuration enables a wide range of type-checking behavior for stricter type safety (e.g., `strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`). Using Astro's base configurations ensures compatibility with Astro's features and type generation.
*   **`include": [".astro/types.d.ts", "**/*"]`**: This array specifies which files TypeScript should be aware of and include in the compilation context.
    *   `.astro/types.d.ts`: This file is automatically generated by Astro and contains type definitions specific to the project, including types for content collections and environment variables.
    *   `"**/*"`: This glob pattern includes all files in all directories within the project root. This ensures TypeScript can analyze `.ts`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, and even `.astro` files (with appropriate tooling/extensions).
*   **`exclude": ["dist"]`**: This array specifies files or directories that should *not* be included in the compilation context. The `dist` directory contains the output of the `astro build` command and should typically be excluded to avoid conflicts or unnecessary processing.
