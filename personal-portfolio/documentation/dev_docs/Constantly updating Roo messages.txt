ROO, your objective is to implement the UI/UX enhancements for the personal portfolio website project.

You have been provided with two key documents:

Portfolio UI Enhancement Research Plan.docx: This document contains the detailed research, findings, and rationale behind the desired UI/UX improvements. Treat this as the source of requirements and the "why" behind the enhancements.
Orchestrator UI Enhancement Implementation Plan.docx: This document outlines the structured, phased plan for executing the implementation. It includes specific tasks, code examples, and detailed guidelines for applying the enhancements. This is your primary execution guide.
Your Task:

Execute the implementation by meticulously following the steps detailed in the Orchestrator UI Enhancement Implementation Plan.docx.

Proceed phase by phase (Phase 1 through Phase 4).
Complete each task within each phase in the specified order.
Strictly adhere to the code examples and implementation guidelines provided within the Orchestrator plan for each task.
Use the Portfolio UI Enhancement Research Plan.docx as a reference only when you need to understand the context or reasoning behind a specific requirement mentioned in the Orchestrator plan.

Thought Process and Initial Steps
To begin, I need to understand the task at hand and the documents provided. The task is to implement UI/UX enhancements for the personal portfolio website project by following the steps detailed in the "Orchestrator UI Enhancement Implementation Plan.docx". This document is the primary execution guide, while the "Portfolio UI Enhancement Research Plan.docx" provides context and rationale behind the enhancements.

Identify and Read Key Documents:

First, I need to read the contents of "Orchestrator UI Enhancement Implementation Plan.docx" to understand the phased plan and specific tasks involved.
I will also read "Portfolio UI Enhancement Research Plan.docx" to grasp the context and requirements.
Analyze the Project Structure:

Understand the current state of the personal portfolio project by examining its file structure and key components.
Create a Detailed Implementation Plan:

Based on the information gathered from the documents and project analysis, I will create a detailed plan for implementing the UI/UX enhancements.
Review and Refine the Plan with the User:

Discuss the plan with the user to ensure it meets their expectations and make any necessary adjustments.
Switch to Appropriate Mode for Implementation:

Once the plan is confirmed, request to switch to the appropriate mode (likely "Code" mode) to start implementing the UI/UX enhancements.
Let's start by reading the "Orchestrator UI Enhancement Implementation Plan.docx" to understand the specific tasks and phased plan.

Establish Base Layout Component (Astro)
Initial Version Control Commit
Phase 2: Homepage Section Enhancements
Create and style Hero Section
Create and style About Section
Create Project Card and Projects Showcase Layout
Create and style Contact Form
Integrate Homepage Components
Version Control Commit (Phase 2)
Phase 3: General UX/UI Enhancements
