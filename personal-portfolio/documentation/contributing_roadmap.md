# Contributing and Roadmap

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the personal portfolio website and provides guidelines for anyone interested in contributing to the project.

## Future Enhancements / Roadmap

Here are some ideas for potential future features and improvements. This list reflects the status after the initial development phase and is subject to change. Contributions for other valuable enhancements are always welcome.

*   **More Advanced Animations:** Further enhance the visual appeal with more sophisticated animations and transitions beyond the current implementations.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Add support for multiple languages.
*   **Advanced Accessibility Features:** Implement more advanced accessibility features, potentially including ARIA patterns for complex components or user preferences (e.g., reduced motion).
*   **CMS Integration:** Explore integrating a headless CMS (like Strapi, Contentful, or Sanity) for easier management of blog posts and project details.
*   **Enhanced Visualizations:** Add more complex or interactive data visualizations to project pages or a dedicated dashboard.
*   **Testing:** Implement a more robust testing strategy (e.g., unit tests for components, end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress).

## Coding Style

This project uses Astro and standard web development practices (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript).

*   Follow standard Astro component structure and best practices.
*   Use semantic HTML.
*   Write clean, readable CSS, following a consistent methodology (e.g., BEM, utility-first, or a combination).
*   If writing JavaScript/TypeScript, follow standard conventions and use clear variable names.
*   Ensure your code is formatted consistently. The project may use Prettier and ESLint (or similar tools) to help maintain code quality and style. Running `npm install` should set up recommended linters/formatters.

By following these guidelines, you help ensure a smooth contribution process and maintain the quality of the project.
