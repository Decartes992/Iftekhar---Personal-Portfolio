# Public Assets (`public/`)

The `public/` directory in an Astro project is used for static assets that are served directly at the root of the website. Files placed in this directory are not processed by Astro's build pipeline and are available at the root URL of your deployed site.

This is the ideal location for assets like:
*   Favicons
*   Robots.txt
*   Manifest files
*   Images or fonts that don't require processing

## Contents

The `public/` directory currently contains the following file:

*   `favicon.svg`: This is the favicon for the website, displayed in browser tabs and bookmarks.
