# Debugging Plan for Portfolio Site

## Initial errors identified:
1. Error: `Expected ">" but found "xmlns"` in `index.astro:24:15` ✓
2. Warning: `getStaticPaths()` ignored in dynamic page `/src/pages/blog/tags/[tag].astro` ✓
3. Error: `Cannot apply unknown utility class: px-6` in Tailwind CSS processing ✓
4. Error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toDateString')` in blog pages ✓

## Issues investigated and fixed:
1. Syntax error in SVG elements in `index.astro` ✓
2. SSR vs Static generation conflict in blog tag pages ✓
3. Tailwind CSS configuration issue preventing recognition of standard utilities ✓
4. Missing or invalid date property in blog posts causing runtime error ✓

## Solutions implemented:

### 1. Fix SVG syntax error in index.astro ✓
- The error was related to improperly formatted SVG in the stats icons
- Changed SVG strings to icon objects with path properties
- Updated AnimatedStatsCounter component to properly render the new icon format

### 2. Fix getStaticPaths warning in blog pages ✓
- Added `export const prerender = true;` to the following pages:
  - `/src/pages/blog/tags/[tag].astro`
  - `/src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro`
  - `/src/pages/blog/index.astro`
- This ensures proper static generation for all blog pages

### 3. Fix Tailwind CSS configuration issue ✓
- Fixed the PostCSS configuration by changing the plugin name from `@tailwindcss/postcss` to `tailwindcss`
- This allows Tailwind to properly recognize standard utility classes like `px-6`

### 4. Fix blog date property issue ✓
- Added proper error handling for undefined date values in blog pages
- Implemented fallback for missing date properties
- Used conditional rendering to safely format dates

## Summary:
All identified issues have been successfully fixed. The build process now completes without errors, and the site should render correctly. The implemented fixes ensure that:

1. SVG content is properly formatted in components
2. Blog pages are correctly pre-rendered during the build process
3. Tailwind CSS utilities are properly recognized
4. Blog date handling is robust against missing or invalid date values

## Next steps:
- Consider implementing additional error handling throughout the codebase
- Add validation for required properties in content collections
- Document the fixes for future reference
