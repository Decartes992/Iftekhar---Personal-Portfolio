				<p class="text-lg mb-4">Hello! I'm Iftekhar Hossain Rafi, an Electrical Engineering student at Dalhousie University with a strong focus on the Computer Engineering option. I'm passionate about the intersection of hardware and software, with hands-on experience in software development (Python, C/C++), embedded systems programming, and system architecture.</p>
				<p class="text-lg mb-4">My academic journey and project work, such as contributing as a core software developer for the Dalhousie Space Systems Lab's LORIS satellite project and working on the MILTON AI-powered training decisions application, have allowed me to develop practical skills in areas like data structures, algorithms, API development, and working with tools like Git, Docker, and Linux.</p>
				<p class="text-lg mb-4">Previously, as a Makerspace Coordinator at Dalhousie's Emera Ideahub, I enjoyed advising students on diverse engineering projects and maintaining a variety of advanced equipment.</p>
				<p class="text-lg mb-4">I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills in software engineering, systems development, and electrical engineering to contribute to innovative projects.</p>
