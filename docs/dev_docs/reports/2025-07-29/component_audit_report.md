# Component Audit Report

This report details the findings from the audit of React components used in the portfolio website, focusing on three key areas: Client-Side API Misuse, Data Handling Errors, and Styling Issues.

## 1. SkillRadarChart.jsx

### Client-Side API Misuse
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: All client-side APIs (`window.addEventListener`, `document.documentElement.classList`) are properly used within `useEffect` hooks.

### Data Handling Errors
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: The component properly checks for the existence of required data (`skills.length`) before processing.

### Styling Issues
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: No layout classes found that could cause invisibility or collapsing issues.

## 2. AnimatedTimeline.jsx

### Client-Side API Misuse
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: The `IntersectionObserver` API is properly used within a `useEffect` hook.

### Data Handling Errors
- **Status**: Potential Issue
- **Details**: The component maps over the `items` prop without explicitly checking if it's an array. While a default empty array is provided, additional validation could be added for robustness.

### Styling Issues
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: No layout classes found that could cause invisibility or collapsing issues.

## 3. AchievementBadge.jsx

### Client-Side API Misuse
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: No client-side APIs are misused in this component.

### Data Handling Errors
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: All required props have appropriate default values.

### Styling Issues
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: No layout classes found that could cause invisibility or collapsing issues.

## 4. ProjectCard3D.jsx

### Client-Side API Misuse
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: No client-side APIs are misused in this component.

### Data Handling Errors
- **Status**: Potential Issues
- **Details**: 
  - The component maps over `tags` and `techStack` props without explicitly checking if they are arrays.
  - While default values are provided, additional validation could improve robustness.

### Styling Issues
- **Status**: Potential Issues
- **Details**:
  - Uses fixed height classes (`h-48`, `h-56`) which might cause display issues on different screen sizes.
  - Uses absolute positioning which could cause layout issues in certain contexts.

## 5. Tilt3D.jsx

### Client-Side API Misuse
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: No client-side APIs are misused in this component.

### Data Handling Errors
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: All required props have appropriate default values.

### Styling Issues
- **Status**: Potential Issues
- **Details**:
  - Uses `will-change-transform` which can cause performance issues if overused.
  - The 3D transform effects might not be supported in all browsers, potentially causing rendering issues.

## 6. ContactForm.jsx

### Client-Side API Misuse
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: No client-side APIs are misused in this component.

### Data Handling Errors
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: Form state management is properly implemented with appropriate default values.

### Styling Issues
- **Status**: Potential Issues
- **Details**:
  - Uses animation classes (`animate-shake`, `animate-fade-in-up`) which might cause visibility issues if not properly defined in the CSS.
  - Uses custom classes (`form-input`, `form-label`) which might have styling conflicts.

## 7. AnimatedStatsCounter.jsx

### Client-Side API Misuse
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: The `IntersectionObserver` API is properly used within a `useEffect` hook.

### Data Handling Errors
- **Status**: Potential Issues
- **Details**:
  - The component maps over the `stats` prop without explicitly checking if each item has the required properties (`value`).
  - While a default empty array is provided for `stats`, additional validation could be added for robustness.

### Styling Issues
- **Status**: No Issues Found
- **Details**: No layout classes found that could cause invisibility or collapsing issues.

## Summary

Overall, the components are well-structured with most following React best practices. The main areas for improvement are:

1. **Data Validation**: Several components could benefit from additional validation when mapping over array props.
2. **Styling Robustness**: Some components use fixed dimensions or custom animation classes that might cause display issues in certain contexts.
3. **Performance Considerations**: The use of `will-change-transform` in Tilt3D.jsx should be monitored for performance impacts.

These issues are generally minor and can be addressed to improve the robustness and maintainability of the components.
