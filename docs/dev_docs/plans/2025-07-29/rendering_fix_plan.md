# Rendering Fix Plan

This plan contains specific, file-by-file instructions for addressing the rendering failures identified in the component audit report.

## 1. ProjectCard3D.jsx

**Issue**: Uses fixed height classes which might cause display issues on different screen sizes and uses absolute positioning which could cause layout issues.

**Fix**: Replace fixed height classes with responsive alternatives and add minimum height as a failsafe.

In `src/components/ProjectCard3D.jsx`:
1. Replace `h-48` and `h-56` classes with responsive height classes like `min-h-[12rem] sm:min-h-[14rem]` 
2. Add a minimum height to prevent layout collapse during debugging

## 2. Tilt3D.jsx

**Issue**: Uses `will-change-transform` which can cause performance issues and 3D transform effects might not be supported in all browsers.

**Fix**: Add a check for browser support for 3D transforms and provide a fallback, and optimize the use of `will-change-transform`.

In `src/components/Tilt3D.jsx`:
1. Add a check for CSS 3D transform support using a feature detection approach
2. Conditionally apply the `will-change-transform` class only when needed
3. Provide a fallback for browsers that don't support 3D transforms

## 3. ContactForm.jsx

**Issue**: Uses animation classes (`animate-shake`, `animate-fade-in-up`) which might cause visibility issues if not properly defined in the CSS.

**Fix**: Define the missing animation classes in the global CSS or replace with existing Tailwind animations.

In `src/components/ContactForm.jsx`:
1. Replace `animate-shake` with a defined Tailwind animation or define the keyframes in global CSS
2. Replace `animate-fade-in-up` with existing Tailwind animations like `animate-fade-in` and `animate-slide-up`
3. Ensure all custom classes (`form-input`, `form-label`) have proper styling definitions

In `src/styles/global.css`:
1. Add definitions for the missing animation keyframes:
   ```css
   @keyframes shake {
     0%, 100% { transform: translateX(0); }
     20%, 60% { transform: translateX(-5px); }
     40%, 80% { transform: translateX(5px); }
   }
   
   .animate-shake {
     animation: shake 0.6s ease-in-out;
   }
   
   @keyframes fadeInUp {
     from {
       opacity: 0;
       transform: translateY(20px);
     }
     to {
       opacity: 1;
       transform: translateY(0);
     }
   }
   
   .animate-fade-in-up {
     animation: fadeInUp 0.5s ease-out;
   }
   ```

## 4. AnimatedTimeline.jsx

**Issue**: Maps over the `items` prop without explicitly checking if it's an array.

**Fix**: Add explicit array validation before mapping.

In `src/components/AnimatedTimeline.jsx`:
1. Add a check to ensure `items` is an array before mapping in the render method
2. Provide a default empty array fallback if `items` is not an array

## 5. AnimatedStatsCounter.jsx

**Issue**: Maps over the `stats` prop without explicitly checking if each item has the required properties.

**Fix**: Add validation for required properties before processing.

In `src/components/AnimatedStatsCounter.jsx`:
1. Add checks to ensure each stat item has the required `value` property before processing
2. Provide default values for missing properties

## 6. ProjectsSection.astro

**Issue**: Project cards might not render properly due to issues in ProjectCard3D.jsx.

**Fix**: Ensure proper grid or flexbox classes for container.

In `src/components/ProjectsSection.astro`:
1. Ensure that the project cards are wrapped in a container with proper grid or flexbox classes
2. Add responsive classes to handle different screen sizes

## 7. About.astro

**Issue**: Layout might collapse during debugging.

**Fix**: Add minimum height to prevent layout collapse.

In `src/components/About.astro`:
1. Add a minimum height (`min-h-screen`) to the main section as a failsafe to prevent layout collapse during debugging
